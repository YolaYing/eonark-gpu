# Calculate SHA256 of SRS Lagrange Forms

This folder contains a Go program that processes a Structured Reference String (SRS) in its **Canonical form**. The program reads the Canonical SRS from standard input, computes its corresponding Lagrange forms, calculates the SHA256 hashes of those Lagrange forms, and prints the resulting hashes to standard output.

The value of `SRS_LK_HASH` in `vars.go` (located in the parent folder) is generated by this program.

## Usage

1. **Build the Program:**

   ```sh
   go build -o calculate_sha256_of_srs_lagrange
   ```

2. **Run the Program:**

   Pass your Canonical SRS file into the program using stdin:

   ```sh
   cat <path_to_canonical_srs_file> | ./calculate_sha256_of_srs_lagrange
   ```

   Replace `<path_to_canonical_srs_file>` with the path to your Canonical SRS file.

3. **Output:**

   The program will print the SHA256 hashes of the derived Lagrange forms to stdout.
